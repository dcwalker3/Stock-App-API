*  Turn: POST http://example.com/order/1/delete
*  Into: DELETE http://example.com/order/1
*  Possible solution would be conditional checking the method and then amount of parameters. So DELETE with one parameter means delete 1 but
*  if there is POST with 15 portfolios we know to add many methods.
*  Such as if there are multiple items items in the portfolio section then we know to add many instead of one.
